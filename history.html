                        <h2>Origins of Holi</h2>
                        <p>Holi is an ancient Hindu festival that marks the arrival of spring. The festival celebrates the eternal love of Radha and Krishna, and the victory of good over evil with the story of Prahlad and Holika.</p>

                        <h2>The Legend of Prahlad</h2>
                        <p>The most popular Holi story is of Prahlad and his aunt Holika. Prahlad's father, the demon king Hiranyakashipu, wanted everyone to worship him. But Prahlad remained devoted to Lord Vishnu. Holika, who had a blessing to be immune to fire, sat with Prahlad in a burning pyre. While Holika burned, Prahlad emerged unscathed due to his devotion.</p>

                        <h2>Krishna and Radha</h2>
                        <p>Another legend associates Holi with Lord Krishna. Krishna, known for his dark blue skin, was worried if fair-skinned Radha would like him. His mother suggested he playfully color Radha's face any color he wanted. This tradition of applying colors became a part of Holi celebrations.</p>
